Android iBeacon Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pieces029/android-ibeacon-service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pieces029/android-ibeacon-service)
=======================

An Android library providing APIs to interact with iBeacons


## What does this library do?

It allows Android devices to use iBeacons much like iOS devices do.  An app can request to get notifications when one
or more iBeacons appear or disappear.  An app can also request to get a ranging update from one or more iBeacons
at a frequency of 1Hz.  

## How to Use this Library

The [project website](http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/ibeacon/android/) is the best place to go if you want
to learn how to use this library.  It includes binary downloads, a quick start guide, sample code, full API docs and even a reference application.

IMPORTANT:  This project now uses an AndroidStudio/gradle build system and the source code may no longer be imported into Eclipse as a library project.
Eclipse users may download the latest release binary as a tar.gz file, which may then be imported as an Eclipse Library Project.  See the quick start on the project website for more information.
